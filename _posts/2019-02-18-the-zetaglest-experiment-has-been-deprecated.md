Most users who participated in the ZetaGlest Discord chat room are
already aware that a few months ago I handed primary maintainership of
ZetaGlest over to <a
href="http://github.com/mathusummut">mathusummut</a>. He has since
renamed ZetaGlest to <a href="https://github.com/glest">Glest</a>,
which means that the ZetaGlest experiment has been deprecated.

Anyone wanting to continue to working on the code may join the Glest
project or <a

the <a href="https://github.com/zetaglest/zetaglest-source">ZetaGlest
repo</a>, which has been archived.
