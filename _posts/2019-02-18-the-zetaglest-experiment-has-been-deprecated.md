Most users who participated in the <i>ZetaGlest</i> Discord chat room are
already aware that a few months ago I handed primary maintainership of
<i>ZetaGlest</i> over to <a
href="http://github.com/mathusummut">mathusummut</a>. He has since
renamed <i>ZetaGlest</i> to <a href="https://github.com/glest"><i>Glest</i></a>,
which means that the ZetaGlest experiment has been deprecated.

The decision to rename <i>ZetaGlest</i> to <i>Glest</i> was made after
I left the project. It's important to mention that the "new"
<i>Glest</i> is not affiliated with the <a
href="http://glest.org/en/index.php">original Glest
game&lt;http://glest.org/en/index.php&gt;</a> from which <a
href="https://megaglest.org/"><i>MegaGlest</i></a> was forked. Also
worth noting, when I initially created the <i>ZetaGlest</i> fork, I <a
href="https://help.github.com/en/articles/duplicating-a-repository">duplicated
(mirrored)</a> the <i>MegaGlest</i> repository; as a result, commits by
the <i>MegaGlest</i> developers and contributors appear in the commit
history. Therefore, it should be also be noted that they have no
affiliation and with the "new" <i>Glest</i> either, nor have they or I
endorsed the decision to change the name. <!--more-->

Anyone wanting to continue to working on the code may join the <i>Glest</i>
project or <a
href="https://help.github.com/articles/duplicating-a-repository/">duplicate</a>
the <a href="https://github.com/zetaglest/zetaglest-source">ZetaGlest
repo</a>, which has been archived.
