  ZetaGlest is a network multi-player real-time strategy game engine.
  It's shipped with the ZetaPack mod, which includes several factions,
  each one consisting of many 3d characters. The factions are loosely
  based on historical empires with added elements of fantasy, such as
  mummies produced by Egyptian priests, Indian shamans who summon
  thunderbirds for air assaults, and Norsemen who can build flying
  valkries and "Thors". Start the game by harvesting natural resources,
  then use the cash to produce an army. Single-player mode against the
  CPU is also available.
